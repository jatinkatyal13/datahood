## Abstract

Data Hood is a web based platform that would provide secure and sophisticated R&amp;D services and trends bridging the gap between Large and Small-Scale Industries and thereby delivering the best possible information derived out of raw sensor data working for the benefit of both the parties.

Data hood is home to the largest open data community for IOT and all related projects. We turn real-time data from sensors into understandable analytics ultimately benefiting both the companies that provide the data and the smaller firms that are lacking in the sector of vital information.

## Intro

With the increase in automation in the production and industrial sector, tremendous amounts of data are being generated each day in large and small scale industrial setups. Sensors used in the production line generate truckloads of raw data which hardly gets used to its complete potential. Data Hood comes in right at this point as we try to gather this raw sensor data, analyze it in ways we find productive and then publish that analysis for smaller scale industries to use.

By doing this, we are bridging the gap of R&amp;D between large and small scale industrial setups by providing a virtual and dedicated R&amp;D data analysis system for corporations to learn from. Thus, forming a form of sensor sharing network wherein small-scale industries can coherently learn and implement better production methods.

##

## Domain

By implementing API&#39;s and ML techniques at an industrial level to crunch the already available data, we would enable a small/large business owner to analyze the trends and relations in the data that is being generated at a regular basis in their production line. Thus, using IIOT i.e. **Industrial Internet of Things** we would land a complete data R&amp;D lab into the hands of a businessman.

## Implementation

1. We tried to find out real life use cases for our idea
2. We studied a sample data set derived from a real-life scenario.
3. We created a portal common to both large and small corporations.
4. We worked with various visualization APIs to generate visualizations out of the uploaded data.
5. Further we are currently working on Machine Learning model to smartly pitch the correct visualizations to the correct industries.
6. R&amp;D for the large-scale industries is still to be covered.

## Problem

1. The one basic problem in wide range use of sensors in industries Is that the huge set of data generated is not used to its full potential. Furthermore, small scale industries can&#39;t afford complete R&amp;D labs to learn better ways of manufacturing which deliver faster and more efficient results. Therefore, the problem here is that there is a set of data that can solve the issue of small manufacturers but it is lying unused, and that has to be corrected!
2. This being the ethical problem, there is one problem that we faced in the business model as well and that is, &quot;Why would a larger corporation provide their data?&quot;

## Solution

1. Data Hood provides a one-step solution to the problem stated above wherein the data i.e. lying completely unused would be converted into extremely vital information for the adequate users. Herein we would take up huge chunks of data from large scale industries, try to make sense out of it and as a small-scale manufacturer picks up a set of data already available on our portal, he/she would get a complete analysis on how that particular set of data derived from that particular industry would affect his/her business. Thus, from the available trends, one can figure out better practices for their own set of work.
2. To overcome the business model issues, we had to come up with a very trivial technical solution –
We have decided to add another segment to our portal that would serve as an R&amp;D replacement for the large-scale corporations. i.e. rather than just capturing the data from them and providing info specific to smaller corporations, we would provide intelligent and self-learning data to the larger corporation as well reducing their dependence on dedicated R&amp;D departments and thereby cutting costs and increasing the profit for the firm.

## USE CASES -

**Example (Real Life Model - SOIL)**

Considering that we take an example of Soil Moisture System which has been derived from the following Kaggle data set i.e. **https://www.kaggle.com/c/afsis-soil-properties**

CropIn is an agricultural firm that installs sensors in the soil so as to detect the moisture content and fertility of the soil during various time fragments of cultivation. This sensor data, would be used to train our classifier which in turn would lead to generation of smart information.

This information can be provided to farmers enabling them to have a clearer picture of the optimum irrigation rotations depending on the crop and the current soil scenario which would improve the general agricultural production manifolds and provide R&amp;D to a sector where it is almost non – existent in India.

Small Scale industries that are already using this data set by CropIn –

1.       CropEx

2.       Farmer&#39;s Edge

3.       Farm Lead

4.       Food LogiQ

## Tech Still to be covered

1. Machine Learning model to smartly form an intelligent link between data and end user i.e. provision of smart suggestions.
2. Visualization provision setup to the large-scale corporations.
3. Final designing of the portal.
